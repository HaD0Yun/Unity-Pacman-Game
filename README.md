## 🤯 The 4 Prompts That Built This Game

The human operator only typed **4 prompts** to create this complete Pacman game:

| # | Human Prompt | What AI Did |
|:-:|:-------------|:------------|
| 1 | *"Hi! We're going to build a classic game called Pac-Man. Right now, this project has no sprites and no scripts, so we'll create everything from start to finish—first by writing a game design plan, then implementing the game based on that plan, and finally recreating the same Game Scene as the reference image you provided"* | Designed architecture, created 17 scripts, built maze system, implemented ghost AI, generated procedural sprites — the entire game |
| 2 | *"TextMesh Pro downloaded"* | Acknowledged and continued with UI implementation |
| 3 | *"Confirmed it's working"* | Verified game functionality and checked for remaining issues |
| 4 | *"Check why the red ghost flies off the map at start"* | Diagnosed Blinky's initial direction bug and fixed it |

**That's it.** One initial prompt to describe the goal, and 3 simple follow-ups.  
The AI handled everything autonomously — design, coding, debugging, and testing.

## 🎮 About

A faithful recreation of the classic Pacman game built with Unity 6 (URP).  
**All sprites are procedurally generated through code** — zero external assets.

### ✨ Key Features

- **100% AI-Built**: Complete game created in 30 minutes
- **Only 4 Human Prompts**: Minimal human intervention required
- **Zero External Assets**: All graphics generated by `ProceduralSpriteGenerator`
- **Classic Maze**: Authentic 28x31 tile layout
- **4 Ghost AI Personalities**: Each with unique chase patterns
  - 🔴 **Blinky (Shadow)**: Directly chases Pacman
  - 🩷 **Pinky (Speedy)**: Ambushes 4 tiles ahead of Pacman
  - 🩵 **Inky (Bashful)**: Flanks using Blinky's position
  - 🟠 **Clyde (Pokey)**: Retreats when within 8 tiles
- **New Input System**: Modern Unity input handling
